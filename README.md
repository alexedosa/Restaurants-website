The Project Journey

This is my first standard React application. It’s a frontend prototype for a premium food platform based in Mowe, Ogun State.

The Learning Curve


Building this was a massive shift from basic HTML to a modern developer workflow:

Directory Management: Learning the industry standard for organizing components and assets was a puzzle at first, but it helped me master project architecture.

Debugging & Logic: I spent hours in the browser console fixing rendering errors and pathing issues. This sharpened my problem-solving skills significantly.

State of Mind: Moving into a component-based mindset was challenging but rewarding.

🛠️ Tech Stack
